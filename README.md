# VideoAudio

### Introduction
The experimental software was ran by MATLAB. Three different conditions was used in the listening test: Clean, Noisy and FCN speech enhancement. Except for the main conditions, two types of noise maskers (Street and Engine) and two SNR (1 and 4 dB) were manipulated in the experiment.

# Effect size
The effect size could help support the statisitcal significance in the paired T-Test without doing correction. Effect size is a quantitative measure of the magnitude of the experimenter effect. The larger the effect size the stronger the relationship between two variables. The results of effect size in Cohen d for each paired T-Test were attached alongside the original tables below. According to the threshold for interpretting effect sizes [reference after the tables], d = 0.20 means small effect size, 0.50 as medium size, and 0.80 as large size. In this study, for 1 dB group, two significant p-values carried 0.4959 and 0.9193 two effect sizes, and they meant nearly medium and large effect sizes, respectively. As in the 4 dB group, one significant pair was with medium effect size of 0.5058. The results of effect size brought a relatively convincing support to believe that the statistical analysis in this study was not generating the false positive outcome.
