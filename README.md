# VideoAudio_Test

### Introduction
The experimental software was ran by MATLAB. Three different conditions was used in the listening test: Clean, Noisy and FCN speech enhancement. Except for the main conditions, two types of noise maskers (Street and Engine) and two SNR (1 and 4 dB) were manipulated in the experiment.
